# NVIM Configuration File
These are my current configurations for Neovim. You are more than welcome to copy if you would like but these configurations are constantly changing so copy at your own risk. I highly recommend learning on your own from the ground up for a better experience :D.

## Requirements
These will not be managed by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/tree/main)
- neovim >= 0.9.0 (recommend to download from source)
- C compiler
- ripgrep

## Future Addiitions
- nerd font (for my terminal)
- linter (nvim-lint)
- formatter (nvim-conform)

## Unrelated Information
I currently use WSL2 Ubuntu on PowerShell. I find a block cursor makes the most sense for me on Vim which can be configured on PowerShell.

## Configs I Learned From
- [folke's dot files](https://github.com/folke/dot)
- [LazyVim (also folke)](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
