# NVIM Configuration File
These are my current configurations for Neovim. You are more than welcome to copy if you would like but these configurations are constantly changing so copy at your own risk. I highly recommend learning on your own from the ground up for a better experience :D.

Use [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master) if you want somewhere to start.

## Requirements
These will not be managed by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/tree/main)
- neovim >= 0.9.0 (personally I use snap but downloading from source works too)
- C compiler
- ripgrep
- nerd font (I prefer [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads))
- npm (for typescript lsp and formatters)

## Future Additions
- probably how to configure luasnip and lsps better
- figure out how to get a rust lsp working properly
- write a bash script to auto-install and set up config along with dependencies

## Personal Set-up
- WSL2 Ubuntu
- block cursor
- aliases in .bashrc
    - `alias vim=nvim`
    - `alias vi=nvim`
    - `alias oldvim='\vim'`
- use nvim as man page viewer through `export MANPAGER='nvim +Man!'`

# How to get NerdFont
If you are on Linux then you probably won't need this but just in case here is a [tutorial](https://medium.com/@almatins/install-nerdfont-or-any-fonts-using-the-command-line-in-debian-or-other-linux-f3067918a88c).

Now if you are using Windows and WSL2 then you need to download a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
1. unzip
2. highlight all files ending in .ttf
3. right click and hit install
4. go to Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell appearance settings and enable set the font to the font you just downloaded
    - ideally you would change the Defaults profile setting to Nerd Font so that it applies across all terminal applications

## Configs I Learned From
- just [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries) (for everything, great youtube videos)
- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master) (most beginner friendly setup, easy to read and follow along)
- [typecraft youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn) (has a nice nvim series for starters)
- [folke's dot files](https://github.com/folke/dot) (because makes everything in neovim)
- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
